      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary of what I did last summer!
Education I took CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory, a class I really enjoyed! I think that taking the class in the summer was challenging and forced me to really consider what I wanted to spend time doing –– making tough decisions about attending discussions, lectures and so on.
I also took CS375: Teaching Techniques for Computer Science, a discussion-based class for first-time teachers.</description>
