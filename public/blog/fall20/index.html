<p>For anyone reading this in the distant future, hello! This article was written in the strange times of the coronavirus. All of humanity has been socially isolated and &ldquo;working from home&rdquo; for over nine months at present time. Dystopia is dreadfully boring.</p>
<p>No matter! There are still things that happened this semester. He&rsquo;s a quick summary of what happened in the fall of 2020. <a href="/about">Read about what I&rsquo;m currently doing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education<a class="anchor" href="#education">#</a></h2>
<p>This fall, I took <a href="https://cs61c.org">CS61C</a>, Berkeley&rsquo;s Intro to Computer Architecture class. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the intrinsics of how computers worked. Knowledge I gained from this class will be applicable across many CS fields.</p>
<p>I also took <a href="https://eecs16b.org">EECS16B</a>, the second half of Designing Information Devices and Systems. This was a circuits and mathematics heavy class that complimented the computer architecture class very well.</p>
<p>Finally, I took <a href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-econ-1-001-lec-001">ECON1</a>, Intro to Economics. In essence, I just wanted to learn about money, and how it worked. I certainly feel like I got that.</p>
<h2 id="teaching">Teaching<a class="anchor" href="#teaching">#</a></h2>
<p>I taught <a href="https://cs61a.org">CS61A</a>, Intro to Computer Science, at Berkeley this fall. Teaching remotely was a strange experience, and I don&rsquo;t think I connected to my students as well as I would have in person. On the other hand, I was able to assist a lot more students over the semester than I would normally.</p>
<h2 id="begin-developer">BEGIN Developer<a class="anchor" href="#begin-developer">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET&rsquo;s <a href="https://begin.berkeley.edu">Gateway To Innovation Program</a>! It&rsquo;s an exciting prospect to be able to help introduce people to the startup space around Berkeley. This semester, I was delighted to be able to connect Berkeley startups to many investment oportunities.</p>
<h2 id="step-organizer">STEP Organizer<a class="anchor" href="#step-organizer">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m helping run Berkeley&rsquo;s <a href="https://step.berkeley.edu">Student Entrepreneurship Program</a>! It&rsquo;s one of the best ways to partake in entrepreneurship across Berkeley, and I&rsquo;m excited to help widen the resources and improve participant experience! This semester, I created and ran the mentorship program within STEP.</p>
<h2 id="cal-hacks-director">Cal Hacks Director<a class="anchor" href="#cal-hacks-director">#</a></h2>
<p><code>CODE. BUILD. HACK.</code></p>
<p>Cal Hacks is the <em>best</em> way to get started making side projects that have impact, meaning and innovation. It was exciting to help coordinate <a href="https://hackmonth.calhacks.io">Hack Month</a>, a month-long endeavor to connect university students to top industry mentors to help them make something awesome!</p>
<h2 id="web-at-berkeley">Web At Berkeley<a class="anchor" href="#web-at-berkeley">#</a></h2>
<p>Helped run the education branch for this new club. Teaching web dev is just as fun as web dev itself. <a href="https://webatberkeley.org">Check out our website here!</a></p>
