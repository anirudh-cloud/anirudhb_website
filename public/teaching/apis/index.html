<p>If you&rsquo;re at all interested in back-end web development, then you&rsquo;ve heard of APIs –– but what are they really?</p>
<h2 id="what-are-apis">What are APIs?<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-apis">#</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that we want to make available data about movies. <code>getLastBlockbuster()</code> returns the last big cinema hit, <code>movieRating('Parasite')</code> returns the imdb rating of the movie Parasite, and so on. This would be a very cool tool to give movie enthusiasts! So you go ahead and write this. How do we make this available to users?</p>
<p>We could make our code <a href="https://opensource.org/">open source</a>. There&rsquo;s a few issues with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have data that you don&rsquo;t want to make public.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using a huge database, developers having to download and store it is inefficient.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no way to keep updating the project as people use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem: how do we give users access while maintaining control? The solution: Make an interface between them and us. They will ask the interface for data, the interface will ask our program, and the value will similarly be returned. Success!</p>
<p>This interface is known as the application programming interface, or API. APIs give the developer a series of commands they can use, whose implementation is abstracted away. <strong>APIs are, simply put, abstractions.</strong></p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s discuss the kinds of APIs, their similarities, differences and uses!</p>
<h2 id="restful-api">RESTful API<a class="anchor" href="#restful-api">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the most common API style. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. They mostly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on some database.</p>
<p>The big idea: interaction between a user and a backend server. The user sends a request to the server. The server takes action based on the request and returns (<strong>transfers</strong>) a data structure which is a <strong>representation</strong> of the <strong>state</strong> of the server. For example, a <code>GET</code> request returns a JSON containing some data about what was requested.</p>
<p>REST APIs are popular because they made optimal use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP protocol</a>. As the HTTP-based infrastructure of servers, caches and proxies was realized to be scalable and long-lived, REST was wholeheartedly adopted alongside it.</p>
<p>The advantage of REST is that it imposes a lot of constraints on the API, to give developers familiar tools and get maximum utility out of its frameworks. This is also its disadvantage – the strict structure doesn&rsquo;t allow new features (for example, ability to remember past query calls) to be added.</p>
<p><a href="">Here&rsquo;s what I wrote about what makes an API RESTful</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rest-like-api">REST-like API<a class="anchor" href="#rest-like-api">#</a></h2>
<p>REST API frameworks have some strict constraints, because of which many API that claim to be rest aren&rsquo;t really REST. How do we judge how close an API is to being RESTful? <a href="">I wrote a blog post about it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="graphql-api">GraphQL API<a class="anchor" href="#graphql-api">#</a></h2>
<p>For a long time, REST APIs had a monopoly. Facebook saw this and really didn&rsquo;t like it. Enter: <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>. Unlike REST, everything is connected in graphQL (its all a *<em>graph</em>*). GraphQL thus leads to more specific queries because resources aren&rsquo;t siloed. It also leads to lesser queries, on average, which is more efficient!</p>
<p>The disadvantages of GraphQL are that it doesn&rsquo;t use HTTP tools as well as REST (no cache support) and has poor error handling in comparison to REST. It&rsquo;s also hard to set up GraphQL structures for small projects.</p>
<h2 id="rpc-api">RPC API<a class="anchor" href="#rpc-api">#</a></h2>
<p>Last but not least is the oldest API style – <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/">RPC</a> has been around since the 1980s. It stands for Remote Call Procedure. Like REST, it works over HTTP. Unlike REST, RPC is used when a limited amount of data needs to be used. RPC allows specificity in requests, while makes it slightly more efficient than REST (which returns entire states).</p>
<p>A popular form of RPC API is the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_soap.asp">SOAP</a> API. It stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. An important note: SOAP is a protocol. SOAP has an official standard, and is maintained by <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. SOAP uses XML for all requests.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to share data with each other, and APIs are definitely the coolest one! If you&rsquo;re a frontend developer like me, backend APIs can be scary. But they are such a wonderful tool, and seeing how varied they are gives some insight about how to get started with using them.</p>
