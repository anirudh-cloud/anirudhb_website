A nook in the library of the internet which I can call my corner. I keep track of what I'm up to, and I write about whatever pleases me once in a while. If I'm in a teaching mood, I publish a tutorial or two. It's a calm place, this corner of the internet. Admittedly, not much happens here. But if you ever want an escape, [this website](https://ani-b.me) is a place as good as any.

[ani-b.me](https://ani-b.me) is made using [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.com) and deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
