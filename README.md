[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bd9efc9d-e181-426c-b206-f6b914800976/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/serene-bartik-5b122b/deploys)

A nook in the library of the internet, away from the facebooks and reddits and twitters of the world. I keep track of what I'm up to, and I write about whatever pleases me once in a while. If I'm in a teaching mood, I publish a tutorial or two. It's a calm place, this corner of the internet. Admittedly, not much happens here. But if you ever want an escape, [this website](https://amks.me) is a place as good as any.

[amks.me](https://amks.me) is made using [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.com) and deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
