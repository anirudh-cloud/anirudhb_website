Hi, I'm Ani.

I was born and raised in India, and currently based out of the UK. I am a Tech Architect and a SaaS enthusiast. For the last 10 years I have been building and shaping products. I have led small and medium sized teams to achieve success and growth.

I love to get my hands dirty in day to day problems by solving them using modern and viable technology. I create, scale and optimize product portfolios that make a difference. To accomplish this, I focus on key results, build amazing teams and quickly adapt to new insights.

Being an entrepreneur I have got to play a myriad of roles throughout my career in product management, product building, technical sales, engineering and strategy.

Over the last couple of years, wherever I would go, whoever I would talk to, all I could hear was how data and machine learning is going to transform the world. It was this that pumped me to take the plunge back to academics and study Business Analytics from one of the best practitioners in the world at Warwick Business School.

With both practical experience of dealing with fortune 500 clients and theoretical knowledge of analytics in my quiver, I am now, more than ever, ready to add value to high impact products.
