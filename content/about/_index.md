Hi, I'm Ani.

I was born and raised in India, and am currently based in the UK. I am a Tech Architect and a SaaS enthusiast. For the last 10 years I have been building and shaping products from scratch. I have led small and medium sized teams to achieve success and growth.

I love to get my hands dirty in day to day problems by solving them using modern and viable technology. I create, scale and optimize product portfolios that make a difference. To accomplish this, I focus on key results, build amazing teams and quickly adapt to new insights.

Being an entrepreneur I have got to play a myriad of roles throughout my career in product management, product building, technical sales, engineering and strategy. To upskill myself further with the best practices in data science and businesses in todayâ€™s businesses, I took the plunge back into academics to study Business Analytics from Warwick Business School. 

With both practical experience of dealing with fortune 500 clients and theoretical knowledge of analytics in my quiver, I am now, more than ever, ready to add value to high impact products. I am now keenly looking for full-time consulting opportunities matching my qualifications and experience.
